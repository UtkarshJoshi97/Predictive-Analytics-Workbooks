## 📂 Notebooks Overview  

### 1️⃣ **Notebook 1: Feature Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning**  
Techniques covered:  
- ✅ **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** – Selecting the most relevant features by iteratively removing the least important ones.  
- ✅ **GridSearchCV** – Automating hyperparameter tuning using different parameter combinations.  
- ✅ **K-Fold Cross-Validation** – Improving model generalization by evaluating it across multiple data splits.  

📌 *More notebooks will be added as I explore new techniques!*
